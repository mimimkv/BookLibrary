# Book Library

>1.	Idea 
>The idea of the project is to develop a web-based library management system. This is a project that manages and stores information about books, users, authors and >borrows. The system helps both users and admins to keep track of all the books that are available in the library at the current time. It also stores information about >borrowed and returned books.  This task if carried out manually will be tedious and includes chances of mistakes. These errors are avoided by allowing the system to >keep track of information such as date of borrow and date to return the book.
